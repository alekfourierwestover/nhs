# This project is to generate a website for NHS
# Instructions
  * Go to the google doc with everyone's Bio in it 
  * click File, download, download as website
  * prettify the html https://htmlformatter.com/ (this is strictly speaking not necessary, but do it anyways)
  * run the parsing code to get separate files for everyone.

  * NOTE: it would be way better if people inputted the bio info via a google sheet, or if I had a list of all the names...

  * you can (probably) get such a list by going to the name section of classroom and 
    - copying the table
    - putting it in http://www.convertcsv.com/html-table-to-csv.htm
    - downloading a csv 
    - warning: this tool is kinda slow
  * now that I have this, it should be possible to make a much better parser 
    - the one stipulation is that it means that I will have to force people to spell their names right in the document!!
